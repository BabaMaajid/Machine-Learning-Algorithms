# What is Docker
- Docker is a containerization platform which packages application and all its dependencies together in the form of Contianers, to ensure that application works seamlessly in any environmment be it Devleopment/Test/Production.
# Benifits 
- RAM consusmed by applications by packaging them into containers.
- Containers are light-weight can be easily shared via Docker Hub(Registry Provided by the docker).
# What is Containeriazation Technology
- Containeriazation technolgy refers to practice of encapsualting an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit called a container.
- Containerization technology enables the bundling of an application with its dependicies,libraries,and runtime environment,ensuring that it can be executed reliably on any system that supports containers,regardless of the underlying infrastructure operating system.
- Containers leverage operating system level virtualization, where multiple containersshare the same host operating system kernel but are isolated from one another.
# Benifits of Containerization
 - **Portabillity**: Containers are  portable across different systems and platforms
 - **Scalabilty** : Contianrs can be easily scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of the same container across a cluster of machines.
 - **Efficiency**: Conatiners are lightweight and have minimal overhead compared to traditional VMs. they share the same host OS, which reduces resource consumption an allows for faster startup times.
 - **Consistency**: Contianers ensure consistent behaviour across different environments. Since the entire runtime environment is bundled within the container, there are fewer dependencies or conflicts with the underlying OS, leading more predictable behavaiour.
- **DevOps Enablement**: Continerization facilitates the adoptation of DevOps practices by providing a standardized and reproducible deployment unit.
