# What is Docker
- Docker is a containerization platform which packages application and all its dependencies together in the form of Contianers, to ensure that application works seamlessly in any environmment be it Devleopment/Test/Production.
# Benifits 
- RAM consusmed by applications by packaging them into containers.
- Containers are light-weight can be easily shared via Docker Hub(Registry Provided by the docker).
# What is Containeriazation Technology
- Containeriazation technolgy refers to practice of encapsualting an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit called a container.
- Containerization technology enables the bundling of an application with its dependicies,libraries,and runtime environment,ensuring that it can be executed reliably and any system that supports containers,regardless of the underlying infrastructure operating system.
- Containers leverage operating system level virtualization, where multiple containersshare the same host operating system kernel but are isolated from one another.
