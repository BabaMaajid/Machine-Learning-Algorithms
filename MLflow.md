# ML Flow
 - An open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle
 - ML flow is an opensource platform to manage the mL life cycle, including experimentation ,reproduciblity deployment and a central model registry.
 - It helps tracking the experiment
# key things to consider in ML approach
- Its an iterative approach in creating ML
- Involves Hyoer parameter tuning to find the best model
- For each change in Training data, new artifacts will be generated and has to be tracked
- Easy to lose the settings of the best perform model if it is not closely monitored
# Components of MLflow
### MLflow tracking
  - Record and query experiments , code ,data,config and results.
### MLflow Projects
 - Package data science code in format to reproduce runs on any platform.
### MLflow Models 
 - Deploy machine learning models in diverse serving environments.
### Model Registry 
- Store, annotate, discover,
# Features of MLflow
- MLflow offers data scientists the flexibilty to conduct numerous experiments before moving a model to production.
- It dilligently records crucial model evaluation metrics like RMSE and AUC, while also maintaining a log of the hyperparameters emplyoed during model development.
- It facilitates the storage of the trained model in conjuction with its optimal hyperparameters.
- Empowers users to seamleesly deploy machine learning mdoels to production servers or cloud environments.
- It allows for the monitoring of the models in both staging and production,ensuring that all team members stay informed.
